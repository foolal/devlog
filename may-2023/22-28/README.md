## Vegancheck API

- If you type in the ingredient `monoglyceride` into the following [link](https://vegancheck.me/ingredients) it says that it is vegan even though acording to [MedicalNewsToday](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321912#what-are-monoglycerides) they can be `"extracted from plant or animal fats and oils"`. Therefore, it being vegan (to my understanding) depends on whether the ingredient came from an animal or plant, requiring you to contact the manufacturer.
	- After searching for an ingredient, it will tell you its datasources which are:
